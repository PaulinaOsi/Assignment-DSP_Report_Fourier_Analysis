# DSP Report on Fourier Transformations

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook that delves into the principles and applications of Fourier transformations within the context of Digital Signal Processing (DSP Module as Part of my Dual Major). The notebook is designed to illustrate various concepts through practical examples and visualizations.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project and assignment is to provide an educational overview of Fourier transformations, demonstrating their importance and utility in analyzing different types of signals. 

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Notebook Overview

- `Fourier_DSP_Report.ipynb`: This notebook includes detailed explanations accompanied by code snippets that explore various DSP concepts using Fourier transformations.

## Running the Notebook

To interact with the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Hereâ€™s how you can run it:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

Open the Fourier_DSP_Report.ipynb file from the Jupyter Notebook interface to view and run the cells
